# SNP_biallelic_to_numeric_conversion

This script can be used to compute minor/major allele count from biallelic (A/T) SNP data format and convert it to -1,0,1 format using the major minor allele count information.

The datasets used in this script are owned by CIMMYT. Hence, the datasets will be added once the project is complete and manuscript is published.
